# Pomodoro Timer
|This was a small, quick project I whipped up on the Arduino Nano to build a physical Pomodoro Timer [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to increase my focus and just to do a fun little electronics project! | <img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3aec559-6733-4e56-8947-ccb84cb1dfb6> |

## Outside Sources
In this project, I utilized (but changed up) code from [phenoxyethanol on Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Progress-Bar-for-Arduino-and-LCD/) for the LCD screen animation. Or you can follow their [YouTube Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcyvoncWcw). Additionally, you will need to install the CountDown library from [Rob Tillaart](https://github.com/RobTillaart/CountDown).
