# Pomodoro Timer
This was a small, quick project I whipped up on the Arduino Nano to build a physical Pomodoro Timer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to increase my focus and just to do a fun little electronics project!

## Outside Sources
In this project, I used code from (https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Progress-Bar-for-Arduino-and-LCD/) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcyvoncWcw)
Additionally, you will need to install the CountDown library from Rob Tillaart (https://github.com/RobTillaart/CountDown)
